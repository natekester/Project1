# Django

Django is a web framework written using [Python](/wiki/Python) that allows for the design of web applications that generate [HTML](/wiki/HTML) dynamically.

Not to be confused with the movie "*Django*". 

Historically, the framework is actually named for [Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt).
